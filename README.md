# DIABETES-PREDICTION-WITH-MACHINE-LEARNING

This repository contains the code and resources for our final year project as computer engineering students at Olabisi Onabanjo University. The project focuses on Diabetes Prediction, a machine learning project that aims to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on certain health parameters. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes based on input features.

## Project Details
- **Project Title:** Diabetes Prediction
- **Student 1 Name:** Banjo Abimbola Moyosola
- **Matric Number:** EES/18/19/0192
- **Student 2 Name:** Enijore Oluwaseyi Adekunle
- **Matric Number:** EES/18/19/0229
- **University:** Olabisi Onabanjo University

## Project Description
The project involves the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on health parameters such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other relevant factors. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of health records, and its performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The repository contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Repository Structure
- **[Jupyter notebook, deployment file, scaler,encoder and model pickle file.]**
